# OpenTKL-ATMEGA32U4-AU based on ojthetiny/OpenTKL

i have changed the PCB to use the ATMEGA32U4-AU chip insted of the ATMEGA32U4-MU chip.

Details:
 - F13 TKL layout supporting ANSI, ISO, stepped and normal CAPS, Split right shift, and split backspace.
 - Jane V2 CE plate.
 - 3 optional internal weight pieces can be filled with foam for dampening or metal for more heft.
 - 7 degree typing angle.
 - Hiney h88c support.
 - Flush USB-C connector built into the PCB, no need for a daughterboard (though the PCB supports it).
 - Skuf feet.
 - Countersunk m3 screws for everything except the plate which uses normal button head m3 screws


Important Info (READ BEFORE ORDERING):
 - I do not offer any sort of warranty for this, nor can I be held liable if something goes wrong.
 - Please, PLEASE look over the design before you do anything with it, it's possible and very likely that there are some errors, I'm just a human.
